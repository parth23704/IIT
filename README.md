# Introduction to Information Technology (4478/8936)

This repository, IIT, stores all my tutorials and assignments for the University of Canberra’s Introduction to Information Technology (4478/8936) course in Semester 2, 2025. It’s set up to organize my work for each week’s tutorials and major assignments, following the problem-solving method (PSM) taught in lectures. The lecturer is added as a collaborator to check my submissions. I use tools like GitHub, Draw.io for flowcharts, and Microsoft Copilot for help, as allowed in the course. This README explains the repository structure and how I upload my work.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into folders for each tutorial and assignment. Each folder contains files for the PSM steps and other deliverables.
